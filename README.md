# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
This repository is to document my code submissions for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.

This is my [certification](https://learn.udacity.com/view-certificate/nd101) obtained on 21st July 2022.

# Chapter 1: Neural Networks
## Project 1: Predict Bike-Sharing Patterns
This project is to predict bike rental ridership required based on historical data using neural networks.

Data Used: https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data 
- From January 1 2011 to December 31 2012

Learnt about sigmoid function, forward propagation, hidden layers and hyperparameter settings.

# Chapter 2: Convolutional Neural Networks
## Project 2: Landmark Classification
This project is to predict the location of image based on any landmarks depicted in the images. 
1. Build CNN from scratch
2. Use transfer learning on CNN
   
Data Used: https://udacity-dlnfd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/landmark_images.zip

Learnt about model architecture, training and testing model and transfer learning.

# Chapter 3: Recurrent Neural Networks
## Project 3: TV Scripts Generation
This project is to build a recurrent neural network that will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes from the training data.

Data Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles

Learnt about lookup tables, tokenization and LSTMs.

# Chapter 4: Generative Adversarial Networks
## Project 4: Face Generation
This project is to define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces to generate new images of faces that look as realisitc as possible.

Data Used: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

Learnt about discriminator and generator.

# Chapter 5: Deploying a Model
## Project 5: Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App
Using PyTorch and SageMaker
This project is to learn how to deploy production models with AWS to a web app using Lambda and API Gateway.

Data Used: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

Learnt about SageMaker, XGBoost, deployment workflow and pipeline.
